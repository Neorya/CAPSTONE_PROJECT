Leaderboard API Module

Provides endpoints for:
- Getting the global leaderboard with paginated rankings
- Calculating total scores across all game sessions for all students
- Handling tied ranks correctly

Scoring System (after Phase 2):
- 50% implementation (based on tests passed)
- 50% reviews (correct error ID = 2x, correct confirm = 1x, wrong = -1x penalty, skip = 0)
